To use this program, you can either execute it in the command line, or run it via any python IDE or similar piece of software, such as PyCharm. If you have a file of links you want it to read from, supply it directly as written in the usage instructions. There are similar instructions for the other arguments of the program. Alternatively, and more simply, this can be run in PyCharm with no link file to process, which will result in it automatically going through all the "to be updated" links. If you dont want it to start from scratch, you can set the "start_from_link" field to be the link you want it to begin processing on. This will discard all preceding links. It should be around line 140 in parse_by_links. 

You will need to sign in to roboblocky manually once the automated browser launches. This will log you out of any other sessions, as Roboblocky does not allow simaltaneous sessions.
